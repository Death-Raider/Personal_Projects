# Project Idea
- The project involves the creation and labeling of minecraft gameplay images.
- Since the project was started in 2020, the project currently uses
  -  yoloV5 for bounding box detection 
  -  basic U-Net architecture for segmentation 
- Autonomous movement is to be implemented and is currently done with static states
- Dataset for bounding box can be found on Roboflow: [minecraft-mob](https://app.roboflow.com/oragimirox-gmail-com/minecraft-mob/6)
- Dataset for segmentation is already present.
