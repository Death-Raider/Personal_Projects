# Microbial Hotspot Tagging  

## **Overview**  
This project is a web-based application designed to map and tag **microbial hotspots**—areas where garbage is piled up, posing potential health hazards. The application allows users to mark such locations, provide relevant details, and view the data on an interactive map. The aim is to alert the local municipal corporation for cleanup while helping people identify and avoid these areas.

## **Features**  

### 1. **Map Integration**  
- Displays an interactive map showing the user’s **current location**.  
- **Pins** are placed on the map to denote identified microbial hotspots.  

### 2. **Form Submission**  
- Users can submit information about a microbial hotspot via a form on the website.  
- Current fields in the form include:  
  - Location data (latitude and longitude).  
  - A textual description of the hotspot.  
  - **Future Extension**: Support for **image uploads** for better identification.  

### 3. **MongoDB Integration**  
- All user-submitted hotspot data is stored in a **MongoDB database**.  
- Users can view all stored hotspot data, including the details of the pins visible on the map.

## **Workflow**  

1. **User Submission**:  
   - Users identify a microbial hotspot and fill out the form with location data and a description.  
   - Submitted data is stored in MongoDB.  

2. **Map Display**:  
   - Pins corresponding to the database entries are displayed on the map.  
   - Users can interact with the map to view detailed information about each pinned location.  

3. **Data Access**:  
   - A separate webpage or section allows users to view all stored data from the database, including pin details.  

4. **Future Enhancements**:  
   - Add the ability to upload **images** to accompany the hotspot description.  
   - Create automated alerts for municipal corporations to notify them of hotspot locations.

## **Technologies Used**  

- **Frontend**:  
  - Interactive map (using **Leaflet.js** ).  
  - Form for data submission (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  

- **Backend**:  
  - API for handling form submissions and fetching data (using **Node.js**).  

- **Database**:  
  - **MongoDB** for storing location data, descriptions, and (future) images.  

- **Geolocation**:  
  - Browser-based geolocation API for obtaining the user’s current location.

## **Purpose and Impact**  

### **Primary Goals**:  
- To alert local municipal corporations about areas requiring immediate cleanup.  
- To raise public awareness and encourage people to avoid microbial hotspots for health and safety.  

### **Benefits**:  
- **Health Awareness**: Reduces exposure to hazardous microbial zones.  
- **Community Involvement**: Allows users to contribute actively to keeping their surroundings clean.  
- **Data Accessibility**: Provides a centralized database of hotspots for better planning and decision-making.

## **Future Scope**  

1. **Real-Time Updates**:  
   - Integrate real-time map updates as new data is added.  

2. **Heatmap Functionality**:  
   - Create a heatmap to visualize the density of microbial hotspots in specific areas.  

3. **Notifications**:  
   - Automated notifications to local authorities when new hotspots are tagged.  

4. **Crowdsourcing Validation**:  
   - Allow multiple users to validate or provide updates for the same hotspot.  

5. **Integration with IoT**:  
   - Use IoT devices or sensors to detect microbial activity in real-time and auto-tag hotspots.  

6. **Mobile App**:  
   - Develop a mobile application for ease of use and increased participation.  

This project not only promotes public health and environmental cleanliness but also empowers communities to take action toward creating healthier living spaces.
