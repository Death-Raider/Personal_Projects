# Google Form Automation  

## Overview:  
This project is designed to automate the process of filling out Google Forms multiple times, simulating realistic user responses. It was created to explore web scraping and automation techniques while incorporating statistical methods for human-like behavior.

## **Key Features**:  
- **Population Simulation**:  
  - Each radial option in the form is selected based on **mean** and **standard deviation**, mimicking population-based response patterns.  
  - The approach ensures diversity in answers while maintaining statistical realism.

- **Human-Like Behavior**:  
  - Introduces delays and randomized interactions to resemble genuine human behavior.  
  - Planned integration of **LLM-based semantic analysis** to make the choices contextually and semantically appropriate.  

- **Extensible Design**:  
  - The project is structured to adapt to different forms and can be modified for forms with various input types (e.g., checkboxes, text fields, dropdowns).

## **Technologies Used**:  
1. **Selenium**:  
   - For automating form navigation and interaction.  
2. **NumPy/Scipy**:  
   - To calculate statistical distributions and simulate user responses.  
3. **Python**:  
   - Core programming language for implementation and control flow.  
4. **Future Integration**:  
   - **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for semantic answer generation.

## **Learning Outcomes**:  
- Gained a deeper understanding of **web scraping**, form interaction, and browser automation.  
- Explored statistical methods to simulate realistic datasets and population behavior.  
- Planned extensions to incorporate advanced NLP techniques for more nuanced and dynamic form filling.

### **Potential Use Cases**:  
- **Survey Simulation**: Stress-testing forms with diverse and statistically meaningful responses.  
- **Research**: Generating large datasets for data analysis or machine learning experiments.  
- **Testing**: Automating the testing of form-based workflows or surveys.  

This project provides a foundation for understanding web scraping and automation, with future enhancements aimed at integrating AI-driven decision-making for smarter automation.
