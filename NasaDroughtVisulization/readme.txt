extract the gddrg.rar file to the same directory as test.js and server.js (empty newData folder is required).
run parseData.js with atleast 5gb ram for it to use (read parseData.js to see how to run it).
run server.js and open localHost at port 3000 after parsedData.js.
parseData.js parses the gddrg.asc and send data to newData folder in the form of 10 text files which the server.js reads and sends.
